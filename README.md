# Interactome Analysis with Ligand and Receptor Data

This repository provides the necessary files and instructions to perform interactome analysis using R code and a Shiny application.

### Running the R Code

To run the R code using the ligand and receptor data:
1. Ensure you have the following files:
    - Interactome list
    - Ligand data
    - Receptor data
    - R code
    
2. Open your R environment (RStudio or any other R IDE).
3. Load the necessary files into your environment.
4. Execute the R code to analyze the interactome data.

### Using the Shiny Application

You can use the Shiny application for interactome analysis by following these steps:
1. Navigate to the [Shiny application](https://sensoryomics.shinyapps.io/Interactome/).
2. You have the option to either upload your ligand and receptor data or use the existing data provided by the application.
3. Follow the instructions in the application to run the interactome analysis.

#### Detailed Step-by-Step Guide
For a more detailed step-by-step guide on using the Shiny application, refer to the attached "Interactome Analysis Detailed Step-by-Step Guide".

## Notes
- Ensure all necessary data files are in the correct format as required by the R code and the Shiny application.
- For any issues or questions, please open an issue in this repository.
